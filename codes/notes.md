## 1. Region of Interest

Focus on only the region where background is completely white. This region spans for about:

- X: 700-1200
- Y: 350-700

For the above region, the equation of the line containing the thin film is
$ y = 0.467x + 160$
The width is 14 px.

## 2. Coordinates of the Needle

- X: 865 (approximately)

  **Note:** The Needle is not perfectly vertical.

- Y: 390 (approximately)

## 3. To-Do

1. Get The equation of the thin film holder (DONE!)
2. Increase the accuracy of the calculated center
3. Check wheter the film can be removed
4. Rotate the image

## 4. Increasing Accuracy

1. Rotating Image
2. Run The Loop only to the thin film
3. Use just one coordinate
